      <h2>What People Can Say About Me:</h2>
      <div class="row">
        <p>Talented developer and lightning fast learner. I had the pleasure of instructing Ashley as she charged through Resilient Coder’s Intensive Bootcamp. No matter the challenge or how short the deadline, Ashley always triumphed. She never settled for just what was due, but pushed boundaries and always delivered a product well above and beyond what was asked. Not only was Ashley’s work ethic unparalleled, but the speed at which she was able to learn new materials was astonishing. Her hard work and ability to quickly understand complex topics made her into a great programmer. If you are looking for a skilled web developer, who can craft exquisite code and learn on the job quickly, Ashley is your candidate.</p>

        <p>Ashley is an impassioned technologist and fast learner. She consistently sets ambitious goals for herself, builds strategies to achieve them, and executes. She has high standards for herself and those around her, jumping eagerly and naturally into a role as a mentor and guide to her peers. I wanted Ashley on my team. You want her on yours.</p>
        <h4>David Delmar</h4>

      <div class="row">
        <p> I was offered (and just started) a great job at PwC – and my website played a large role in me landing the job. The top criteria was an impressive portfolio of published work and clearly my website more than fit the bill...can’t thank you enough for all the attention and time you put into creating a vital job search tool.</p>
